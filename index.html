            <h3 class="heading">Labrador Retriever</h3>
            <p class="first">Labrador retrievers are the most popular dog breed in the United States. There are numerous reasons for the desire to have one at home, ranging from their friendly nature and outgoing attitude to their willingness to try almost anything.The Labrador Retriever or Labrador is a British breed of retriever gun dog. It was developed in the United Kingdom from fishing dogs imported from the independent colony of Newfoundland (now part of Canada), and is named for the Labradorregion of that colony.When you have this breed at home, there will be plenty of affection to go around for everyone. They are a larger dog, but by no means unmanageable at 70-80 pounds for most individuals. Many of them live to be 10-12 years of age, although some individuals can live for up to 20 years. Spaying or neutering will help to encourage longevity and reduce the risk of unwanted offspring.</p>

        <h3 class="heading">Guide dog</h3>
        <p id="2">Evidence suggests that dogs may have been used as guides for the visually impaired based on depictions of a blind-man being guided by his dog on the wall of a house.There is an apparent discrepancy between the actual number of guide dog owners and the proportion of visually impaired people who might benefit from a guide dog. This research aimed to provide an understanding of the reasons why many visually impaired people have not applied for a guide dog, the range of benefits offered by guide dogs, and how these might vary amongst different populations and under different circumstances. While previous research described a number of psychological and social benefits of assistant animal ownership, consistent with the companion animal literature, it also pointed to the importance of personal and social context on the impact and effectiveness of assistance animals. </p>

        <h3 class="heading">Breed standards</h3>
        <p id="3">There is a great deal of variety among Labradors.Labradors are a medium-large breed. The Labrador Retriever's coat should be short and dense, but not wiry. The coat is water-resistant, so the dog does not get cold when taking to water in the winter. That means that the dog naturally has a slightly dry, oily coat. Acceptable colours are black, yellow, and chocolate.The Labrador Retriever is a strongly built, medium-sized, short-coupled, dog possessing a sound, athletic, well-balanced conformation that enables it to function as a retrieving gun dog; the substance and soundness to hunt waterfowl or upland game for long hours under difficult conditions; the character and quality to win in the show ring; and the temperament to be a family companion.</p>
